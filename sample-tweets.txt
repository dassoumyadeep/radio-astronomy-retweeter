RADIO ASTRONOMY
GOOD - 
Such a fun, memorable adventure with @shivibhandari & Rui! We spoke radio astronomy until our hearts were content, photographed galaxies, and got a really special learning experience with the @CSIRO_ATNF Parkes 

GOOD - 
Astronomers have mapped a million previously undiscovered galaxies in record time using the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) operated by @CSIRO. A massive achievement. This story and more in the #DUGBlog. #RadioAstronomy #SKA #BigData

GOOD - 
And in doing so was able to observe multiple peaks from the different arms of the Galaxy, in addition to calculate doppler shifts! Some amazing radio astronomy community science work in action! 

BAD - 
Like other #SpaceAusScope projects, the waveguide was an old olive oil can.But Kent also built a nice Alt-Az mount and so was able to point the telescope at different parts of the sky ...https://spaceaustralia.com/news/wheelie-bin-radio-telescope

GOOD - 
Check this out: The Max Planck Insitute for #RadioAstronomy offers two #Postdoc positions. Will one of them be yours? Right pointing backhand index  http://ow.ly/hdqO50D63Wq @maxplanckpress

BAD - 
So I went and had a hearing test (as I have been hearing ringing in my ears for about 6 months) and it turns out that Tinnitus is not a condition itself, but a symptom of other issues - in my case, it was sever stress (started 6 months ago because of the friggen pandemic!)
